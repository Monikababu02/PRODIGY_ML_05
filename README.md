Project Overview:
Dataset: I'm utilizing the comprehensive "Food-101" dataset from Kaggle, which features images of 101 food categories. Access it here: Food-101 Dataset.

Model Development: I'm employing deep learning techniques to build a robust model that not only identifies food items but also provides accurate calorie estimates. This integration of image recognition and nutritional analysis is poised to offer invaluable insights into dietary habits.

User Empowerment: By accurately tracking dietary intake, this tool will empower users to make informed decisions, supporting healthier eating habits and personalized diet plans.

This project is not just about technological innovation; itâ€™s about creating a tool that can contribute to better health and well-being. Stay tuned for more updates as we move closer to a healthier tomorrow!
